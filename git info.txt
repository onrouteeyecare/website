GIT

git commit -m 'text goes here'  /make a commit

git status / shows you tracked files

git diff / shows changes

git add <specific file>  / called staging

<then you commit>

//If you dont do '-m' with a message then VIM txt editor will open up
In VIM: hit esc then 'i' for insert to put your changes in where you can describe specific changes you made


//

git commit -a -m <  > / skips staging part

git commit -m "day of change"
git remote add origin https://github.com/onrouteeyecare/website.git

git remote -v //lists all remotes and their urls



Starting a brand new site??
make new repositry on github
go to folder in cmd
type -> git init  // creates a git file that contains all the change info, created locally in folder
type -> git add .   // adds files from current folder to git file
type -> git commit -m "this was done"   // commits files and lets you type a message
go to repositry website to find next line for cmd
type -> git remote add origin https://github.com/<usnername>/<repository name.git>
type -> git push origin master // not sure if you use 'master' or 'gh-pages' since I've been using the later

enter username and password - should upload and you should then be able to see the files on the github website
